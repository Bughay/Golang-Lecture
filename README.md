# Golang Lecture Notes


Lecture about Golang data types and how to effectively work with structs, methods, and pointers. and how to structure golang modules. 
Also we wrote a python function to demonstrate what exactly happens with golang code when we use go build command

Plus something cool: I wrote a little Python script that sort of shows what happens when you run go build. It's not exact, but it helps picture the process.

# structure

#### Golang datatype

here we just show simple datatypes and how they work.


#### Golang_Structs

Here we learned what are structs, how we can create OOP/Class like behaviour in golang and then created a simple Transaction program.

we then turned everything to binary format using go build and created a python script to demonstrate how the code actually looks like when it becomes computer readable in the format of assembly and machine code.
